# codeRefactor
This assignment was to have us clean up and leave someone else's code better than we had found it in both HTML and CSS.

# What I did 
In the HTML I tried my best to clean up the spacing and tabing of each line so that they read a little more clearly and so that there wasn't as much white space left around then was needed. 
I also kept the wording for the paragraphs on the websit within the screen so that the next user doesn't have to scroll left and right to look at everything as a whole. 
With the CSS I felt like I could find more ways to clean it up then the HTML. I went in and found all the elements that had the same styling and spacing and padding and put them together into one. That way you didn't have to read through multiple sections of the same style elements just applied to different sections of the website. For example: the three main paragraphs on the page for search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing, all had the same style elements being applied to them. So instead of having all three written out individually, I just combined them all in to one so minimize the amount of CSS code for the page.
